#To run
in separate terminals, navigate to Api and Frontend folders
run "npm run start" in each.

Frontend is accessible at localhost:3000. 
Api is accessible at localhost:3001. 

There is also a docker instance for the API if you find you have trouble connecting when started from the terminal.
In this instance use ./startApi.sh rather than the usual npm startup command.
